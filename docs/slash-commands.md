# Slash-command and skill reference

`holocore setup` generates client-native commands non-destructively:

- Claude: project slash commands and project skills.
- Codex: `$`-invoked project skills under `<project>/.agents/skills`.
- Gemini: TOML command definitions.
- Cursor and OpenCode: native project command files.

The generated command or skill delegates to the stable HoloCore CLI.

Claude also receives a top-level `/holocore` orientation command. It reports
status and paths and points to the specific commands below. Use `/holocore-search`
for a focused knowledge search and `/holocore-doctor` for MCP diagnostics.

## Claude Code

After setup:

1. Restart Claude.
2. Run `/mcp`.
3. Approve or confirm HoloCore.
4. Invoke `/holocore-search`.

The generated MCP prompt is also available as `/mcp__holocore__search`. Claude automatic capture is a separate `SessionEnd` hook installed by setup.

## Codex

After setup:

1. Restart or reopen the project.
2. Run `/hooks`.
3. Review and trust the HoloCore Stop hook.
4. Invoke `$holocore-search`.

Codex does not use HoloCore slash commands. Details following a `$holocore-*` skill mention are interpreted as arguments for the corresponding CLI command.

Generated write workflows tell the AI client to confirm scope before execution. Client approval remains required even though HoloCore writes the integration files automatically.
